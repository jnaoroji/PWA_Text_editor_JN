# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Jenny Naoroji's Text Editor

## Description

My task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. This single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. 

Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

This application will implement methods for getting anf storing data to an IndexedDB database. A lightweight wrapper package called `idb` will be used to feature methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data.

This full-stack application will be deployed to Heroku.
